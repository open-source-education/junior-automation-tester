## About

This is a **quickly path** for those of you who want to complete a **Junior Software Developer** accelerated course on your own time, **for free**, by  **professionals in the field** from all over the world.

In our syllabus, we give preference to MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) style courses because these courses were created with our style of learning in mind.

To become a Junior Software Developer, you have to learn quite a lot of computer science high level topics, so be ready for subjects like; linux, Database, cloud, devops,  etc...

## Motivation

Here the main motivations to create this github organization that can make **all** the difference in your journey.

The first one is the imperative need of share my knowledge. Human knowledge, science and technology would be nothing if they weren't shared.

The second is to help to the young people to be prepared to obtain a job in any part of world. Not everyone has the opportunity to take class on a University or Institute , public or private. So if you are self-taught, here you could gain knowledge to be prepared to affront a job, earn money, pay your rent, help yours and of course share what you learn.

And here what Elon Musk said about self-taught, skills over the degrees and work like hell:

- A college degree isn't required for a job at Tesla â€” and Apple, Google, and Netflix don't require employees to have 4-year degrees either
- There's no need even to have a college degree at all, or even high school. Musk said after being asked whether he considered which college a job applicant attended when evaluating a prospective Tesla employee: If somebody graduated from a great university, that may be an indication that they will be capable of great things, but it's not necessarily the case. If you look at, say, people like Bill Gates or Larry Ellison, Steve Jobs, these guys didn't graduate from college, but if you had a chance to hire them, of course that would be a good idea.
- If there's a track record of exceptional achievement, then it's likely that that will continue into the future.

Also here a motivational video that shows a guy that went through the "MIT Challenge", which consists of learning the entire **4-year** MIT curriculum for Computer Science in **1 year**.

## Prerequisite

The **only things** that you need to have or know are:

- Linux/Mac/Windows desktop or laptop. Linux is recommended
- Internet connection
- Programming basics

## How to use this guide

### How to Learn

Thist will teach you learning techniques used by experts in art, music, literature, math, science, sports, and many other disciplines. These are **fundamental abilities** to succeed in our journey.

- [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)

### Order of the classes

This guide was developed to be consumed in a linear approach. What does this mean? That you should complete one course at a time.

The courses are **already** in the order that you should complete them. Just start the first course, [English for software developers], when you done with it, start the next one.

**If the course is not open, do it with the archived resources or wait until next class is open.**

### How to track and show your progress

1. Create an account in [Trello](https://trello.com/).
1. Copy [this](https://trello.com/b/yax8Kgnh) board to your personal account. See how to copy a board [here](http://blog.trello.com/you-can-copy-boards-now-finally/).

Now that you have a copy of our official board, you just need to pass the cards to the `Doing` column or `Done` column as you progress in your study.

We also have **labels** to help you have more control through the process. The meaning of each of these labels is:

- `Main Curriculum`: cards with that label represent courses that are listed in our curriculum.
- `Extra Courses`: cards with that label represent courses that was added by the student.
- `Doing`: cards with that label represent courses the student is current doing.
- `Done`: cards with that label represent courses finished by the student. Those cards should also have the link for at least one project/article built with the knowledge acquired in such course.
- `Section`: cards with that label represent the section that we have in our curriculum. Those cards with the `Section` label are only to help the organization of the Done column. You should put the *Course's cards* below its respective *Section's card*.
- `Extra Sections`: cards with that label represent sections that was added by the student.

The intention of this board is to provide for our students a way to track their progress, and also the ability to show their progress through a public page for friends, family, employers, etc. You can change the status of your board to be **public** or **private**.



### Should I take all courses?

**Yes!** The intention is to conclude **all** the courses listed here! Also we highly encourage you to complete more by reading papers and attending research projects after your coursework is done.

### Duration of the course

It may take longer to complete all of the classes compared to a  regular Bioinformatics course, but we can **guarantee** you that your **reward** will be proportional to **your motivation/dedication**!

You must focus on your **habit**, and **forget** about goals. Try to invest 1 ~ 2 hours **every day** studying this curriculum. If you do this, **inevitably** you'll finish this curriculum.

> See more about "Commit to a process, not a goal" [here](http://jamesclear.com/goals-systems).

### Project Based

Here you do **not** need to take exams, because we are focused on **real projects**!

In order to show for everyone that you **successfully** finished a course, you should create a **real project** or write **papers and publish them** about your focus with Bioinformatics.

> "What does it mean?"


  <!-- Put the OSSU-Bioinformatics badge in the README of your repository! [![Open Source Society University - Bioinformatics](https://img.shields.io/badge/OSSU-bioinformatics-blue.svg)](https://github.com/open-source-society/bioinformatics)

  - Markdown: `[![Open Source Society University - Bioinformatics ](https://img.shields.io/badge/OSSU-bioinformatics-blue.svg)](https://github.com/open-source-society/bioinformatics)`
  - HTML: `<a href="https://github.com/open-source-society/bioinformatics"><img alt="Open Source Society University - Bioinformatics" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/OSSU-bioinformatics-blue.svg"></a>` -->

**You can create this project alone or with other students!**

### Be creative!

This is a **crucial** part of your journey through all those courses.

You **need** to have in mind that what you are able to **create** with the concepts that you learned will be your certificate **and this is what really matters**!

In order to show that you **really** learned those things, you need to be **creative**!

Here are some tips about how you can do that:

- **Articles**: create blog posts to synthesize/summarize what you learned.
- **GitHub repository**: keep your course's files organized in a GH repository, so in that way other students can use it to study with your annotations.

### Cooperative work

**We love cooperative work**! Use our [channels](#community) to communicate with other fellows to combine and create new projects!

<!-- ### Which programming languages should I use?

List of skills:
- C/C++
- Unix System
- Python/Perl
- R
- Algorithms

These skills mentioned above are the very essential tool set that bioinformatician and computational biologist depends on.

The **important** thing for each course is to **internalize** the **core concepts** and to be able to use them with whatever tool (programming language) that you wish. -->

### Content Policy

You must share **only** files that you are **allowed** to! **Do NOT disrespect the code of conduct** that you signed in the beginning of some courses.

[Be creative](#be-creative) in order to show your progress! :smile:
